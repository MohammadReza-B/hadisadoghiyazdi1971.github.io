Modern outdoor positioning systems, such as the **Global Positioning System**, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" style="text-decoration:underline; color:green;" target="_blank"><strong>GPS</strong></a> offer high accuracy for navigation in open spaces but face challenges when used indoors due to **weakened satellite signals** inside buildings. To overcome this limitation, a variety of *indoor positioning systems* (IPS) have emerged. IPS is extensively applied in environments like schools, offices, supermarkets, hospitals, and universities. For instance, in supermarkets, shoppers can use digital guide screens on carts equipped with RFID tags to easily locate products. In museums, visitors can access exhibit information using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices. IPS also aids students in navigating specific shelves in libraries and is utilized in targeted marketing, such as sending personalized advertisements to individuals based on their location within a building.
